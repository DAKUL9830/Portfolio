                   Hello,My name is Dmitry. 		 	 	 		
Before starting Fullstack Academy to become a software engineer, I studied in CUNY with majors:Game Design and Computer Science. 		 	 	 		
I enjoyed my practice work, but I often found myself imagining a gratifying and stimulating job solving tough problems and building tools that made a lasting difference. In April of 2020, the path became clear for me to pursue a job in coding, and in July, I enrolled in Fullstack Academyâ€™s software engineering program. After dedicating four months of forty plus hours a week learning numerous programming languages and tools, I consider myself a full-stack developer, with a solid foundation in the NERD stack. But the biggest skill I learned since joining the coding world is how to take a brand new tool or language and have it feel like an old friend.
